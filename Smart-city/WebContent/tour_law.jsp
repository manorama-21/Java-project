        <h1>Law Museum & Archives (A wing of High Court of Judicature at Allahabad)</h1>
        <p class="category">Category: Historic</p>
        <p>The Indian High Courts Act, 1861 provided for the establishment of the Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras High Courts. It also reserved power in Her Majesty Queen Victoria to constitute similar High Courts in any other part of the country. The Letters Patent/Charter dated 17th March, 1866 was issued constituting the High Court of Judicature for North-Western Provinces which started functioning at Agra on 18th June, 1866. It shifted to Allahabad in 1869 and functioned in the building which now houses the Board of Revenue. On 27th November, 1916, it was shifted to its present building. The name of the High Court was changed to High Court of Judicature at Allahabad by Supplementary Letters Patent dated 11th March, 1919.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>In 1966, the centenary celebration of this Court took place. The celebration committee chaired by the then Honourable Chief Justice Sri Nasirullah Beg with Honourable Mr. Justice S.N. Katju as its honorary secretary conceived a plan to mount an exhibition of judicial records, photographs of Honourable Chief Justices and other artefacts during the centenary celebrations. The exhibition was highly appreciated by the visitors, including foreign dignitaries. Later it was decided to convert the exhibition into a museum of Court records. Therefore, a Museum was set up within the High Court premises containing very old and rare documents relating to the judicial system, landmark judgments, firmans of Mughal emperors, judgments in Persian language (which was the Court language during the British Period before the establishment of the High Court in 1866) and photographs of Honourable Chief Justices from 1866 up to the present arranged chronologically, the British emblem and photographs of Honourable Judges who were elevated as Judges and Chief Justices of Supreme Court of India, eminent members of the Bar and old furniture.</p>
         <br>
        <p>Thereafter, with financial aid from the State Government, a new independent building of the Law Museum and Archives was built. This was inaugurated in 2021 by the then Chief Justice, Shri Justice Govind Mathur. This is the only Law Museum of its kind in India.</p>
        
         <br><p>The Law Museum and Archives also contains valuable materials for research on the past judicial system and also the British judicial system in India. The rare and valuable documents and firmans of Mughal rulers and others, available in the Museum, provide glimpses of the old judicial system and administration.</p>
       
        <br> <p>The vision and mission is to preserve and showcase valuable materials on the judicial and administrative system of the past. The High Court Museum has a large collection of four to five hundred years old rare documents comprising of judgments, decrees, orders, rupkars, notices, deeds etc. relating to Sadar Diwani and other Adalats of the past and firmans of Mughal and other rulers, all written in Persian, which was the language of the court. These are invaluable records having archival and historical importance and are precious material for research work.</p>
