	<br>

		This project android tourist guide provides the tourist with city map depending on its current location entered. This information helps the tourists to find the desired locations to visit. Well it consists of entire details of those locations or how to reach the location as well as other emergency amenities like hospitals, institutes, bus stops etc but it provides the basic information to decide the places to visit. This project is mainly beneficial for the touristâ€™s having no idea about the places they want to visit. By providing a geographic based information system the tourists and people shifting to new cities can get a better guidance of the places they want to visit .This proposed application does not require any internet access and thus eliminates the disadvantage of single point failure. By making the application GIS based, it includes many advantages as the user can view the required location in map and accordingly estimate the time that will be required to reach the final destination. The system gives the basic details that will be required such as an image of that place along with basic details like the address, contact no etc.
